1. finished last method at customer service tests (get customer details)
2. Readme file with instructions
3. delete the numbers of the testing. Its not necessary
4. "getCustomerCouponsByMaxPrice"- fixed. The problem was at the testing method.
5. I'v read the instructions of the project and make sure we added all in. in my opinion er should start part 3.



To Do List:
*******make the password in HASHCODE!! - I don't think its necessary at this part of the project.
 can be a lot of bug because of the change and its not requested at the project instructions.
*******There ara a lot of error types that aren't being used. I think we should delete them.
